### 24. Concatenating Strings with Plus Operator

In JavaScript, when the `+` operator is used with a `String` value, it is called the concatenation operator. You can build a new string out of other strings by concatenating them together.

**Example**
```js
'My name is Alan,' + ' I concatenate.'
```

**Note:** Watch out for spaces. Concatenation does not add spaces between concatenated strings, so you'll need to add them yourself.

**Example:**
```js
var ourStr = "I come first. " + "I come second.";
```
The string `I come first. I come second.` would be displayed in the console.
