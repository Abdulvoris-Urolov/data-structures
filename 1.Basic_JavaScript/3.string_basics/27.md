### 27. Appending Variables to Strings
Just as we can build a string over multiple lines out of string literals, we can also append variables to a string using the plus equals (+=) operator.

**Example:**
```js
var anAdjective = "awesome!";
var ourStr = "freeCodeCamp is ";
ourStr += anAdjective;
```
`ourStr` would have the value `freeCodeCamp is awesome!.`

- [x] **Task-27** Set `someAdjective` to a string of at least 3 characters and append it to `myStr` using the `+=` operator

``Editing area `` **:point_down: :point_down: :point_down:**

```js
// Change code below this line

var someAdjective;
var myStr = "Learning to code is ";
```
