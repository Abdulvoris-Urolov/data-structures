### 26. Constructing Strings with Variables

Sometimes you will need to build a string, Mad Libs style. By using the concatenation operator (+), you can insert one or more variables into a string you're building.

**Example:**
```JS
var ourName = "freeCodeCamp";
var ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";
```
`ourStr` would have a value of the string `Hello, our name is freeCodeCamp, how are you?.`

- [x] **Task-26** Set `myName` to a string equal to your name and build `myStr` with `myName` between the strings `My name is` and and `I am well!`

```js
// Only change code below this line
var myName;
var myStr;
```
