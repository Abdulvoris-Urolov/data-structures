#### 29. Use Bracket Notation to Find the First Character in a String

Bracket notation is a way to get a character at a specific index within a string.

Most modern programming languages, like JavaScript, don't start counting at 1 like humans do. They start at 0. This is referred to as Zero-based indexing.

For example, the character at index 0 in the word `Charles` is C. So if `var firstName = "Charles"`, you can get the value of the first letter of the string by using `firstName[0]`.

**Example:**
```js
var firstName = "Charles";
var firstLetter = firstName[0];
```
`firstLetter` would have a value of the string `C`.

- [x] **Task-29** Use bracket notation to find the first character in the `lastName` variable and assign it to `firstLetterOfLastName`.

**Hint:** Try looking at the example above if you get stuck

```js
// Setup
var firstLetterOfLastName = "";
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
firstLetterOfLastName = lastName; // Change this line
