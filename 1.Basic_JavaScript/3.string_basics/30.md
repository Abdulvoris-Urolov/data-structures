### 30.Understand String Immutability

In JavaScript, `String` values are immutable, which means that they cannot be altered once created.

For example, the following code:
```js
var myStr = "Bob";
myStr[0] = "J";
```
cannot change the value of ``myStr` to `Job`, because the contents of myStr cannot be altered. Note that this does not mean that `myStr` cannot be changed, just that the individual characters of a string literal cannot be changed. The only way to change `myStr` would be to assign it with a new string, like this:
```js
var myStr = "Bob";
myStr = "Job";
```
***********************************
- [x] **Task-30** Correct the assignment to myStr so it contains the string value of Hello World using the approach shown in the example above.

```js
// Setup
var myStr = "Jello World";

// Only change code below this line
myStr[0] = "H"; // Change this line
// Only change code above this line
```
