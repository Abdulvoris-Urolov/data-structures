### 25. Concatenating Strings with the Plus Equals Operator

We can also use the `+= `operator to concatenate a string onto the end of an existing string variable. This can be very helpful to break a long string over several lines.

**Note:** Watch out for spaces. Concatenation does not add spaces between concatenated strings, so you'll need to add them yourself.

**Example:**
```js
var ourStr = "I come first. ";
ourStr += "I come second.";
```
`ourStr` now has a value of the string `I come first. I come second..`

- [x]  **Task-25** - **Build `myStr` over several lines by concatenating these two strings:`This is the first sentence` and `This is the second sentence.` using the `+= `operator. Use the `+=`operator similar to how it is shown in the editor. Start by assigning the first string to `myStr`, then add on the second string**


``Editing area `` **:point_down: :point_down: :point_down:**

```js
// Only change code below this line

var myStr;
```
