`Number` is a data type in JavaScript which represents numeric data.

**Example:**

```js
myVar = 5 + 10;
```

`myVar` now has the value `15`.


- [x] **Task - 8**  - **Change the `0` so that sum will equal `20`.**

``Editing area `` **:point_down: :point_down: :point_down:**

```js
var sum = 10 + 0;
```
