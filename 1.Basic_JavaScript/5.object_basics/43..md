### 43. Accessing Object Properties with Bracket Notation
The second way to access the properties of an object is bracket notation (`[]`). If the property of the object you are trying to access has a space in its name, you will need to use bracket notation.

However, you can still use bracket notation on object properties without spaces.

Here is a sample of using bracket notation to read an object's property:
```js
var myObj = {
  "Space Name": "Kirk",
  "More Space": "Spock",
  "NoSpace": "USS Enterprise"
};
myObj["Space Name"];
myObj['More Space'];
myObj["NoSpace"];
```
`myObj["Space Name"]` would be the string `Kirk`, `myObj['More Space']` would be the string `Spock`, and `myObj["NoSpace"]` would be the string `USS Enterprise`.

Note that property names with spaces in them must be in quotes (single or double).

- [x] **Task-43** - **Read the values of the properties an `entree` and `the drink` of `testObj` using bracket notation and assign them to `entreeValue` and `drinkValue` respectively.**


``Editing area `` **:point_down: :point_down: :point_down:**

```js
// Setup
var testObj = {
  "an entree": "hamburger",
  "my side": "veggies",
  "the drink": "water"
};

// Only change code below this line

var entreeValue = testObj;   // Change this line
var drinkValue = testObj;    // Change this line
```
