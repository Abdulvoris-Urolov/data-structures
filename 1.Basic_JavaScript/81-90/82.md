### 82. Comparison with the Greater Than Or Equal To OperatorPassed
The greater than or equal to operator (`>=`) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is greater than or equal to the number to the right, it returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

Like the equality operator, the greater than or equal to operator will convert data types while comparing.

**Examples** 
```js
6   >=  6
7   >= '3'
2   >=  3
'7' >=  9
```
In order, these expressions would evaluate to `true`, `true`, `false`, and `false`.

- [x] **Task82**
  Add the greater than or equal to operator to the indicated lines so that the return statements make sense.


```js
function testGreaterOrEqual(val) {
  if (val) {  // Change this line
    return "20 or Over";
  }

  if (val) {  // Change this line
    return "10 or Over";
  }

  return "Less than 10";
}

testGreaterOrEqual(10);
```
