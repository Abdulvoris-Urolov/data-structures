### 70. Comparison with the Strict Inequality Operator
The strict inequality operator (`!==`) is the logical opposite of the strict equality operator. It means "Strictly Not Equal" and returns `false `where strict equality would return `true` and vice versa. The strict inequality operator will not convert data types.

**Examples**
```js
3 !==  3
3 !== '3'
4 !==  3
```
In order, these expressions would evaluate to `false`, `true`, and `true.`
****************************************************
- [x] **Task_70  Add the strict inequality operator to the `if` statement so the function will return the string `Not Equal` when `val` is not strictly equal to `17`**

```js
// Setup
function testStrictNotEqual(val) {
  if (val) { // Change this line
    return "Not Equal";
  }
  return "Equal";
}

testStrictNotEqual(10);
```
