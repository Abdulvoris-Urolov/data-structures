### 62. Assignment with a Returned Value

If you'll recall from our discussion of `Storing Values with the Assignment Operator`, everything to the right of the equal sign is resolved before the value is assigned. This means we can take the return value of a function and assign it to a variable.

Assume we have pre-defined a function `sum` which adds two numbers together, then:
```js
ourSum = sum(5, 12);

```
will call `sum` function, which returns a value of `17` and assigns it to `ourSum` variable.

- [x] **Task_62 Call the `processArg` function with an argument of `7` and assign its return value to the variable `processed`.**

````js
// Setup
var processed = 0;

function processArg(num) {
  return (num + 3) / 5;
}

// Only change code below this line
```
