### 66 Comparison with the Equality Operator

There are many comparison operators in JavaScript. All of these operators return a boolean `true` or `false` value.

The most basic operator is the equality operator `==`. The equality operator compares two values and returns `true` if they're equivalent or `false `if they are not. Note that equality is different from assignment `(=)`, which assigns the value on the right of the operator to a variable on the left.
```js
function equalityTest(myVal) {
  if (myVal == 10) {
     return "Equal";
  }
  return "Not Equal";
}
```

If `myVal` is equal to `10,` the equality operator returns `true`, so the code in the curly braces will execute, and the function will return` Equal`. Otherwise, the function will return `Not Equal`. In order for JavaScript to compare two different data types (for example, `numbers` and `strings`), it must convert one type to another. This is known as Type Coercion. Once it does, however, it can compare terms as follows:
```js
1   ==  1
1   ==  2
1   == '1'
"3" ==  3
```

In order, these expressions would evaluate to `true`, `false`, `true`, and `true`.

- [x] **Task_66 Add the equality operator to the indicated line so that the function will return the string `Equal` when `val` is equivalent to `12`.**

```js
editing area
// Setup
function testEqual(val) {
  if (val) { // Change this line
    return "Equal";
  }
  return "Not Equal";
}

testEqual(10);
```


editing area
// Setup
function testEqual(val) {
  if (val) { // Change this line
    return "Equal";
  }
  return "Not Equal";
}

testEqual(10);
