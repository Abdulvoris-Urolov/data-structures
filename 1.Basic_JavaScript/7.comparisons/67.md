### 67. Comparison with the Strict Equality Operator

Strict equality `(===)` is the counterpart to the equality operator `(==)`. However, unlike the equality operator, which attempts to convert both values being compared to a common type, the strict equality operator does not perform a type conversion.

If the values being compared have different types, they are considered unequal, and the strict equality operator will return false.

**Examples**
```js
3 ===  3
3 === '3'
```
These conditions would return `true` and` false` respectively.

In the second example, `3` is a `Number` type and `'3'` is a `String` type.
************************************


- [x] **Task_67  Use the strict equality operator in the if statement so the function will return the string Equal when val is strictly equal to 7**

```js
// Setup
function testStrict(val) {
  if (val) { // Change this line
    return "Equal";
  }
  return "Not Equal";
}

testStrict(10);
```
