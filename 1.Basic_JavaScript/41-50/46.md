### 46. Delete Properties from a JavaScript ObjectPassed
We can also delete properties from objects like this:
```js
delete ourDog.bark;
```
**Example:**
```js
var ourDog = {
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"],
  "bark": "bow-wow"
};

delete ourDog.bark;
```
After the last line shown above, `ourDog` looks like:
```js
{
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"]
}
```
***************************************
- [x] **Task-46** Delete the `tails` property from `myDog`. You may use either dot or bracket notation
