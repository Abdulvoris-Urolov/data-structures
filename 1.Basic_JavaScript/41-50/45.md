### 45. Add New Properties to a JavaScript ObjectPassed
You can add new properties to existing JavaScript objects the same way you would modify them.

Here's how we would add a `bark` property to `ourDog`:
```js
ourDog.bark = "bow-wow";
```
or
```js
ourDog["bark"] = "bow-wow";
```
Now when we evaluate `ourDog.bark`, we'll get his bark, `bow-wow`.

**Example:**
```js
var ourDog = {
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"]
};
```
ourDog.bark = `"bow-wow"`;
