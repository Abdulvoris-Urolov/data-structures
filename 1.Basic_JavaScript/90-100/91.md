### 91. Golf CodePassed

In the game of golf, each hole has a `par`, meaning, the average number of `strokes` a golfer is expected to make in order to sink the ball in the hole to complete the play. Depending on how far above or below `par` your `strokes` are, there is a different nickname.

Your function will be passed `par` and `strokes` arguments. Return the correct string according to this table which lists the strokes in order of priority; top (highest) to bottom (lowest):

**Strokes**        **Return**
```js
1  "Hole-in-one!"
```
<= par - 2  "Eagle"
```js
par - 1  "Birdie"
```
par  "Par"
```js
par + 1  "Bogey"
```
par + 2  "Double Bogey"
```js
>= par + 3  "Go Home!"
```
************************************
- [x] **Task_91  `par` and `strokes` will always be numeric and positive. We have added an array of all the names for your convenience.**
```js
var names = ["Hole-in-one!", "Eagle", "Birdie", "Par", "Bogey", "Double Bogey", "Go Home!"];
function golfScore(par, strokes) {
  // Only change code below this line


  return "Change Me";
  // Only change code above this line
}

golfScore(5, 4);
```
