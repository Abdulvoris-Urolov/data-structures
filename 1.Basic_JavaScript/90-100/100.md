### 100. Record Collection



 You are given a JSON object representing a part of your musical album collection. Each album has a unique id number as its key and several other properties. Not all albums have complete information.
*******************************
You start with an `updateRecords` function that takes an object like `collection`, an `id`, a `prop` (like `artist` or `tracks`), and a `value`. Complete the function using the rules below to modify the object passed to the function.

-  Your function must always return the entire object.
- If `prop` isn't `tracks` and `value` isn't an empty string, update or set that album's `prop` to `value`.
- If `prop` is `tracks` but the album doesn't have a `tracks` property, create an empty array and add `value` to it.
If `prop` is `tracks` and `value` isn't an empty string, add `value` to the end of the album's existing `tracks` array.
- If `value` is an empty string, delete the given `prop` property from the album.
  
**Note:** A copy of the `collection` object is used for the tests.
