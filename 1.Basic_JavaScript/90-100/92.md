### 92. electing from Many Options with Switch Statements

If you have many options to choose from, use a switch statement. A `switch` statement tests a value and can have many case statements which define various possible values. Statements are executed from the first matched `case` value until a `break` is encountered.

Here is an example of a `switch` statement:
```js
switch(lowercaseLetter) {
  case "a":
    console.log("A");
    break;
  case "b":
    console.log("B");
    break;
}
```
`   ` values are tested with strict equality (`===`). The` break` tells JavaScript to stop executing statements. If the `break` is omitted, the next statement will be executed.
**********************************************
- [x] **Task_92 Write a switch statement which tests val and sets answer for the following conditions:**
  
`1` - `alpha`
`2` - `beta`
`3` - `gamma`
`4` - `delta`

```js
function caseInSwitch(val) {
  var answer = "";
  // Only change code below this line



  // Only change code above this line
  return answer;
}

caseInSwitch(1);
```
