### 35. Store Multiple Values in one Variable using JavaScript Arrays

With JavaScript `array` variables, we can store several pieces of data in one place.

You start an array declaration with an opening square bracket, end it with a closing square bracket, and put a comma between each entry, like this:

```js
var sandwich = ["peanut butter", "jelly", "bread"]
```
********************************
- [x] **Task_35** - **Modify the new array `myArray` so that it contains both a `string` and a `number` (in that order).**

**36 Nest one Array within Another ArrayPassed**

You can also nest arrays within other arrays, like below:
```js
[["Bulls", 23], ["White Sox", 45]]
```
This is also called a _multi-dimensional array._

- [x] **Task_36** - **Create a nested array called myArray.**

``Editing area `` **:point_down: :point_down: :point_down:**

```js
// Only change code below this line
var myArray = [];
```
