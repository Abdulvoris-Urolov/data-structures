### 39. Access Multi-Dimensional Arrays With Indexes

One way to think of a *multi-dimensional array*, is as an *array of arrays*. When you use brackets to access your array, the first set of brackets refers to the entries in the outer-most (the first level) array, and each additional pair of brackets refers to the next level of entries inside.

**Example**
```js
var arr = [
  [1,2,3],
  [4,5,6],
  [7,8,9],
  [[10,11,12], 13, 14]
];
arr[3];
arr[3][0];
arr[3][0][1];
```

`arr[3]` is `[[10, 11, 12]`, `[13, 14]`, `arr[3][0]` is `[10, 11, 12]`, and `arr[3][0][1]` is `11`.


**Note:** There shouldn't be any spaces between the array name and the square brackets, like `array [0][0] `and even this `array [0] [0]` is not allowed. Although JavaScript is able to process this correctly, this may confuse other programmers reading your code.
