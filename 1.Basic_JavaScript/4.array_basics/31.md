### 31. Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth Character in a String

You can also use bracket notation to get the character at other positions within a string.

Remember that computers start counting at `0`, so the first character is actually the zeroth character.

**Example:**

```jsvar firstName = "Ada";
var secondLetterOfFirstName = firstName[1];

```
`secondLetterOfFirstName` would have a value of the string `d`.

- [x] **Task_31** - **Let's try to set `thirdLetterOfLastName` to equal the third letter of the `lastName` variable using bracket notation.**


**Hint:** Try looking at the example above if you get stuck.

```js
// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
var thirdLetterOfLastName = lastName; // Change this line

```
