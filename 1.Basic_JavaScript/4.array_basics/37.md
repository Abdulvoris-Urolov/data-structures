### 37. Access Array Data with Indexes

We can access the data inside arrays using indexes.

Array indexes are written in the same bracket notation that strings use, except that instead of specifying a character, they are specifying an entry in the array. Like strings, arrays use zero-based indexing, so the first element in an array has an index of `0`.


**Example**
```js
var array = [50,60,70];
array[0];
var data = array[1];
```
`array[0]` is now `50`, and `data` has the value `60`.


**Note:** There shouldn't be any spaces between the array name and the square brackets, like `array [0]`. Although JavaScript is able to process this correctly, this may confuse other programmers reading your code.
