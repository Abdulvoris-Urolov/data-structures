### 55. Write Reusable JavaScript with FunctionsPassed

In JavaScript, we can divide up our code into reusable parts called *functions*.

Here's an example of a function:
```js
function functionName() {
  console.log("Hello World");
}
```
You can call or invoke this function by using its name followed by parentheses, like this: `functionName();` Each time the function is called it will print out the message `Hello World` on the dev console. All of the code between the curly braces will be executed every time the function is called.
