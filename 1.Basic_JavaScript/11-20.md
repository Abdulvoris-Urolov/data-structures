### 11. Divide One Number by Another with JavaScriptPassed
We can also divide one number by another.

JavaScript uses the `/` symbol for division.

**Example**

```js
myVar = 16 / 2;
```
`myVar` now has the value `8`.

- [x] **Task - 11**  - **Change the `0` so that the quotient is equal to `2`.**

``Editing area `` **:point_down: :point_down: :point_down:**

```js
var quotient = 66 / 0;
```
*************************************************************************************

### 12. Increment a Number with JavaScriptPassed

You can easily increment or add one to a variable with the `++` operator.

`i++;` is the equivalent of  `i = i + 1;`

**Note:** The entire line becomes `i++;`, eliminating the need for the equal sign.


- [x] **Task - 12  - Change the code to use the `++` operator on `myVar`.**

``Editing area `` **:point_down: :point_down: :point_down:**

```js
var myVar = 87;

// Only change code below this line
myVar = myVar + 1;
```
*************************************************************************************

### 13. Decrement a Number with JavaScript
You can easily *decrement* or decrease a variable by one with the `--` operator.

`i--;` is the equivalent of `i = i - 1;`

**Note:** The entire line becomes `i--;`, eliminating the need for the equal sign.

- [x] **Task - 13**  - **Change the code to use the `--` operator on `myVar`.**

``Editing area `` **:point_down: :point_down: :point_down:**

```js
var myVar = 11;

// Only change code below this line
myVar = myVar - 1;
```
*************************************************************************************
### 14. Create Decimal Numbers with JavaScriptPassed

We can store decimal numbers in variables too. Decimal numbers are sometimes referred to as *floating point* numbers or *floats*.
**Note:** Not all real numbers can accurately be represented in floating point. This can lead to rounding errors. Details Here.

- [x] **Task - 14**  - **Create a variable `myDecimal` and give it a decimal value with a fractional part (e.g. `5.7`).**

``Editing area `` **:point_down: :point_down: :point_down:**

```js
var ourDecimal = 5.7;

// Only change code below this line
```
*************************************************************************************
### 15. Multiply Two Decimals with JavaScript
In JavaScript, you can also perform calculations with decimal numbers, just like whole numbers.

Let's multiply two decimals together to get their product.

- [x] **Task - 15**  - **Change the `0.0` so that product will equal `5.0`.**

``Editing area `` **:point_down: :point_down: :point_down:**

```js
var product = 2.0 * 0.0;
```

*************************************************************************************
### 16. Divide One Decimal by Another with JavaScript
Now let's divide one decimal by another.

- [x] **Task - 16**  - **Change the `0.0` so that quotient will equal to `2.2`.**

``Editing area `` **:point_down: :point_down: :point_down:**

```js
var quotient = 0.0 / 2.0; // Change this line
```
*************************************************************************************
### 17. Finding a Remainder in JavaScript
We can also divide one number by another.

JavaScript uses the `/` symbol for division.

**Example**

```js
myVar = 16 / 2;
```
`myVar` now has the value `8`.

- [x] **Task - 11**  - **Change the `0` so that the quotient is equal to `2`.**

``Editing area `` **:point_down: :point_down: :point_down:**

```js
var quotient = 66 / 0;
```
*************************************************************************************
### 11. Divide One Number by Another with JavaScriptPassed
We can also divide one number by another.

JavaScript uses the `/` symbol for division.

**Example**

```js
myVar = 16 / 2;
```
`myVar` now has the value `8`.

- [x] **Task - 11**  - **Change the `0` so that the quotient is equal to `2`.**

``Editing area `` **:point_down: :point_down: :point_down:**

```js
var quotient = 66 / 0;
```
*************************************************************************************
### 11. Divide One Number by Another with JavaScriptPassed
We can also divide one number by another.

JavaScript uses the `/` symbol for division.

**Example**

```js
myVar = 16 / 2;
```
`myVar` now has the value `8`.

- [x] **Task - 11**  - **Change the `0` so that the quotient is equal to `2`.**

``Editing area `` **:point_down: :point_down: :point_down:**

```js
var quotient = 66 / 0;
```
