### 11. Divide One Number by Another with JavaScriptPassed
We can also divide one number by another.

JavaScript uses the `/` symbol for division.

**Example**

```js
myVar = 16 / 2;
```
`myVar` now has the value `8`.

- [x] **Task - 11**  - **Change the `0` so that the quotient is equal to `2`.**

``Editing area `` **:point_down: :point_down: :point_down:**

```js
var quotient = 66 / 0;
```
*************************************************************************************

### 12. Increment a Number with JavaScriptPassed

You can easily increment or add one to a variable with the `++` operator.

`i++;` is the equivalent of  `i = i + 1;`

**Note:** The entire line becomes `i++;`, eliminating the need for the equal sign.


- [x] **Task - 12  - Change the code to use the `++` operator on `myVar`.**

``Editing area `` **:point_down: :point_down: :point_down:**

```js
var myVar = 87;

// Only change code below this line
myVar = myVar + 1;
```
*************************************************************************************

### 13. Decrement a Number with JavaScript
You can easily *decrement* or decrease a variable by one with the `--` operator.

`i--;` is the equivalent of `i = i - 1;`

**Note:** The entire line becomes `i--;`, eliminating the need for the equal sign.

- [x] **Task - 13**  - **Change the code to use the `--` operator on `myVar`.**

``Editing area `` **:point_down: :point_down: :point_down:**

```js
var myVar = 11;

// Only change code below this line
myVar = myVar - 1;
```
*************************************************************************************
### 14. Create Decimal Numbers with JavaScriptPassed

We can store decimal numbers in variables too. Decimal numbers are sometimes referred to as *floating point* numbers or *floats*.
**Note:** Not all real numbers can accurately be represented in floating point. This can lead to rounding errors. Details Here.

- [x] **Task - 14**  - **Create a variable `myDecimal` and give it a decimal value with a fractional part (e.g. `5.7`).**

``Editing area `` **:point_down: :point_down: :point_down:**

```js
var ourDecimal = 5.7;

// Only change code below this line
```
*************************************************************************************
### 15. Multiply Two Decimals with JavaScript
In JavaScript, you can also perform calculations with decimal numbers, just like whole numbers.

Let's multiply two decimals together to get their product.

- [x] **Task - 15**  - **Change the `0.0` so that product will equal `5.0`.**

``Editing area `` **:point_down: :point_down: :point_down:**

```js
var product = 2.0 * 0.0;
```

*************************************************************************************
### 16. Divide One Decimal by Another with JavaScript
Now let's divide one decimal by another.

- [x] **Task - 16**  - **Change the `0.0` so that quotient will equal to `2.2`.**

``Editing area `` **:point_down: :point_down: :point_down:**

```js
var quotient = 0.0 / 2.0; // Change this line
```
*************************************************************************************
### 17. Finding a Remainder in JavaScript

The `remainder` operator `%` gives the remainder of the division of two numbers.

**Example**

```js
5 % 2 = 1 because
Math.floor(5 / 2) = 2 (Quotient)
2 * 2 = 4
5 - 4 = 1 (Remainder)
```
**Usage**
In mathematics, a number can be checked to be even or odd by checking the remainder of the division of the number by `2`.

```js
17 % 2 = 1 (17 is Odd)
48 % 2 = 0 (48 is Even)
```
**Note:** The remainder operator is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the modulus operator. It is very similar to modulus, but does not work properly with negative numbers.

- [x] **Task - 17**  - **Set `remainder` equal to the remainder of `11` divided by `3` using the remainder `(%)` operator.**

``Editing area `` **:point_down: :point_down: :point_down:**

```js
// Only change code below this line

var remainder;
```

### 18. Compound Assignment With Augmented Addition
In programming, it is common to use assignments to modify the contents of a variable. Remember that everything to the right of the equals sign is evaluated first, so we can say:

`myVar = myVar + 5;`
to add `5` to `myVar`. Since this is such a common pattern, there are operators which do both a mathematical operation and assignment in one step.


One such operator is the `+=` operator.

```js
var myVar = 1;
myVar += 5;
console.log(myVar);
```
`6` would be displayed in the console.


- [x] **Task - 18**  - **Convert the assignments for `a`, `b`, and `c` to use the `+=` operator.**

``Editing area `` **:point_down: :point_down: :point_down:**

```js
var a = 3;
var b = 17;
var c = 12;

// Only change code below this line
a = a + 12;
b = 9 + b;
c = c + 7;
```
*************************************************************************************
### 19. Compound Assignment With Augmented Subtraction
Like the `+=` operator, `-=` subtracts a number from a variable.

`myVar = myVar - 5;` 

will subtract 5 from myVar. This can be rewritten as:

`myVar -= 5;`
- [x] **Task - 19**  - **Convert the assignments for `a`, `b`, and `c` to use the `-=` operator.**

``Editing area `` **:point_down: :point_down: :point_down:**

```js
var a = 11;
var b = 9;
var c = 3;

// Only change code below this line
a = a - 6;
b = b - 15;
c = c - 1;
```
*************************************************************************************
### 20. Compound Assignment With Augmented Multiplication
The `*=` operator multiplies a variable by a number.

`myVar = myVar * 5;`

will multiply `myVar` by `5.` This can be rewritten as:

`myVar *= 5;`

- [x] **Task - 20**  - **Convert the assignments for `a`, `b`, and `c` to use the `*=` operator.**

``Editing area `` **:point_down: :point_down: :point_down:**

```js
var a = 5;
var b = 12;
var c = 4.6;

// Only change code below this line
a = a * 5;
b = 3 * b;
c = c * 10;
```
