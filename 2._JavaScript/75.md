### 75. Comparisons with the Logical And Operator
Sometimes you will need to test more than one thing at a time. The logical and operator (`&&`) returns `true` if and only if the operands to the left and right of it are true.

The same effect could be achieved by nesting an if statement inside another if:
```js
if (num > 5) {
  if (num < 10) {
    return "Yes";
  }
}
return "No";
```
will only return `Yes` if `num` is greater than `5` and less than `10`. The same logic can be written as:
```js
if (num > 5 && num < 10) {
  return "Yes";
}
return "No";
```
*****************************
- [x] **Task 75** Replace the two if statements with one statement, using the `&&` operator, which will return the string `Yes` if `val` is less than or equal to `50` and greater than or equal to `25`. Otherwise, will return the string `No`.

```js
function testLogicalAnd(val) {
  // Only change code below this line

  if (val) {
    if (val) {
      return "Yes";
    }
  }

  // Only change code above this line
  return "No";
}

testLogicalAnd(10);
```
