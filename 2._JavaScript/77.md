### 77. Introducing Else StatementsPassed
When a condition for an `if` statement is true, the block of code following it is executed. What about when that condition is false? Normally nothing would happen. With an `else` statement, an alternate block of code can be executed.
```js
if (num > 10) {
  return "Bigger than 10";
} else {
  return "10 or Less";
}
```
***********************************
- [x] **Task 77** Combine the `if` statements into a single `if/else` statement.

```js
function testElse(val) {
  var result = "";
  // Only change code below this line

  if (val > 5) {
    result = "Bigger than 5";
  }

  if (val <= 5) {
    result = "5 or Smaller";
  }

  // Only change code above this line
  return result;
}

testElse(4);
```
