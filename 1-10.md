#### 1.Comment Your JavaScript CodePassed

Comments are lines of code that JavaScript will intentionally ignore. Comments are a great way to leave notes to yourself and to other people who will later need to figure out what that code does.

There are two ways to write comments in JavaScript:

Using ``//`` will tell JavaScript to ignore the remainder of the text on the current line. This is an in-line comment:

```js
// This is an in-line comment.
```
You can make a multi-line comment beginning with `/*` and ending with `*/`. This is a multi-line comment:

```js
/* This is a
multi-line comment */
```

**NOTE**: As you write code, you should regularly add comments to clarify the function of parts of your code. Good commenting can help communicate the intent of your codeâ€”both for others and for your future self.

- [x] **Task - 1 - Try creating one of each type of comment.**

#### 2.Declare JavaScript Variables

In computer science, data is anything that is meaningful to the computer. JavaScript provides *eight different data types* which are 
```shell
   1.undefined,
   2.null, 
   3.boolean, 
   4.string, 
   5.symbol, 
   6.bigint, 
   7.number, 
   8.object.
```


For example, computers distinguish between numbers, such as the number `12`, and `strings`, such as `"12"`, "dog", or `"123 cats"`, which are collections of characters. Computers can perform mathematical operations on a number, but not on a string.


*Variables* allow computers to store and manipulate data in a dynamic fashion. They do this by using a "label" to point to the data rather than using the data itself. Any of the eight data types may be stored in a variable.

Variables are similar to the x and y variables you use in mathematics, which means they're a simple name to represent the data we want to refer to. Computer variables differ from mathematical variables in that they can store different values at different times.

We tell JavaScript to create or declare a variable by putting the keyword `var` in front of it, like so:

`var ourName;`

creates a variable called `ourName`. In JavaScript we end statements with semicolons. Variable names can be made up of numbers, letters, and `$` or `_`, but may not contain spaces or start with a number.

- [x] **Task - 2**  - **Use the var keyword to create a variable called myName.**

Hint
Look at the ourName example above if you get stuck

#### 3. Storing Values with the Assignment Operator
In JavaScript, you can store a value in a variable with the assignment operator (`=`).

`myVariable = 5;`

This assigns the Number value `5` to `myVariable`.

If there are any calculations to the right of the = operator, those are performed before the value is assigned to the variable on the left of the operator.
```js
var myVar;
myVar = 5;
```

First, this code creates a variable named `myVar`. Then, the code assigns `5` to `myVar`. Now, if `myVar` appears again in the code, the program will treat it as if it is `5`.

- [x] **Task - 3**  - **Assign the value `7` to variable `a`.**


``Editing area `` **:point_down: :point_down: :point_down:**

```js
// Setup
var a;

// Only change code below this line
```

*************************************************************************************

#### 4. Assigning the Value of One Variable to Another

After a value is assigned to a variable using the assignment operator, you can assign the value of that variable to another variable using the *assignment* operator.

```js
var myVar;
myVar = 5;
var myNum;
myNum = myVar;
```
The above declares a `myVar` variable with no value, then assigns it the value `5`. Next, a variable named `myNum` is declared with no value. Then, the contents of `myVar` (which is `5`) is assigned to the variable `myNum`. Now, `myNum` also has the value of `5`.

- [x] **Task - 4**  - **Assign the contents of a to variable b.**

``Editing area `` **:point_down: :point_down: :point_down:**

```js

// Setup
var a;
a = 7;
var b;

// Only change code below this line
```

*************************************************************************************

#### 5. Initializing Variables with the Assignment Operator

It is common to initialize a variable to an initial value in the same line as it is declared.

`var myVar = 0;`

Creates a new variable called `myVar` and assigns it an initial value of `0`.


- [x] **Task - 5**  - **Define a variable `a` with `var` and initialize it to a value of `9`.**

```


*************************************************************************************

#### 6. Understanding Uninitialized Variables

When JavaScript variables are declared, they have an initial value of `undefined`. If you do a mathematical operation on an `undefined` variable your result will be `NaN` which means *"Not a Number"*. If you concatenate a string with an `undefined` variable, you will get a literal string of `undefined`.

- [x] **Task - 6**  - **Initialize the three variables `a`, `b`, and `c` with `5`, `10`, and `"I am a"` respectively so that they will not be `undefined`.**

``Editing area `` **:point_down: :point_down: :point_down:**

```js
// Only change code below this line
var a;
var b;
var c;
// Only change code above this line

a = a + 1;
b = b + 5;
c = c + " String!";
```

*************************************************************************************


#### 7. Understanding Case Sensitivity in VariablesPassed

In JavaScript all variables and function names are case sensitive. This means that capitalization matters.

`MYVAR` is not the same as `MyVar` nor `myvar`. It is possible to have multiple distinct variables with the same name but different casing. It is strongly recommended that for the sake of clarity, you do not use this language feature.

**Best Practice**

Write variable names in JavaScript in *camelCase*. In *camelCase*, multi-word variable names have the first word in lowercase and the first letter of each subsequent word is capitalized.

**Examples:**
```js
var someVariable;
var anotherVariableName;
var thisVariableNameIsSoLong;
```

- [x] **Task - 7**  - **Modify the existing declarations and assignments so their names use camelCase.**

Do not create any new variables.

```js
// Variable declarations
var StUdLyCapVaR;
var properCamelCase;
var TitleCaseOver;

// Variable assignments
STUDLYCAPVAR = 10;
PRoperCAmelCAse = "A String";
tITLEcASEoVER = 9000;
```

#### 8. Add Two Numbers with JavaScriptPassed
`Number` is a data type in JavaScript which represents numeric data.

Now let's try to add two numbers using JavaScript.

JavaScript uses the `+` symbol as an addition operator when placed between two numbers.

**Example:**

```js
myVar = 5 + 10;
```

`myVar` now has the value `15`.


- [x] **Task - 8**  - **Change the `0` so that sum will equal `20`.**

``Editing area `` **:point_down: :point_down: :point_down:**

```js
var sum = 10 + 0;
```
*************************************************************************************


#### 9. Subtract One Number from Another with JavaScriptPassed

We can also subtract one number from another.

JavaScript uses the `-` symbol for subtraction.

**Example**
```js
myVar = 12 - 6;
```
`myVar` would have the value 6.

- [x] **Task - 9**  - **Change the `0` so the difference is `12`.**

``Editing area `` **:point_down: :point_down: :point_down:**

```js
var difference = 45 - 0;
```

*************************************************************************************

#### 10. Multiply Two Numbers with JavaScriptPassed
We can also multiply one number by another.

JavaScript uses the `*` symbol for multiplication of two numbers.

**Example**

```js
myVar = 13 * 13;
```
`myVar` would have the value `169`.

- [x] **Task - 10**  - **Change the `0` so that product will equal `80`.**

``Editing area `` **:point_down: :point_down: :point_down:**

```js
var product = 8 * 0;
```
